Welcome to AutoSA's documentation!
==================================

AutoSA is an end-to-end systolic array compiler for FPGAs based on the polyhedral model. 
It takes algorithms in high-level programming languages (C) as inputs, 
performs polyhedral transformation and other architecture optimizations to map algorithms 
to systolic array architecture.
